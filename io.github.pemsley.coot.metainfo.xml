    <summary>Software for macromolecular model-building</summary>
    <description>
        <p>
            <em>Coot</em> is for macromolecular model building, model completion and validation, particularly
            suitable for protein modelling using X-ray data.
            <em>Coot</em>  displays maps and models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real
            space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search,
            solvation, mutations, rotamers, Ramachandran plots, skeletonization,
            non-crystallographic symmetry and more.

            These days it is useful for cryo-EM data and models, too.

            <em>Coot</em> has some features that resemble those of Frodo, O, Quanta and XtalView's XFit.

            Or perhaps PyMOL or ChimeraX. It is much better at graphics than it used to be.

            To be clear, It is a completely independent of any of the above software. <em>Coot</em> can now
            do many aspects of structure represention (for example ribbons or sophisticated
            colouring schemes).

            <em>Coot</em> is under active development. New features are being added.

            Moorhen is the sister project to <em>Coot</em>: "Coot on the Web" you might call it - although it
            has grown in scope since the first year and is now capable of making some
            attractive-looking publication quality images also. If that is of interest, you can try
            it out at moorhen.org.
